# Optimizing the Distribution of Rabies Tags for Orleans Parish
## DSC 680 - Applied Data Science - Project 2

Anyone who owns a pet is familiar with the routine of yearly rabies vaccinations.  Rabies is a virus that affects mammals and is most often transmitted through an infected animal’s bite. When a pet receives a rabies vaccination, the owner is given a tag to put on the animal’s collar.  Rabies vaccination programs are managed differently by each municipality and offer more benefits than just mitigating the rabies occurrence in the community. They generate additional revenue for the agencies providing animal welfare services and can aid in the return of lost animals.  The income from the Orleans Parish rabies tag program plugs a hole in the funding deficit from the city of New Orleans for animal control services provided by the Louisiana SPCA’s Humane Law and Rescue team. In this project, the distribution of tags over time for Orleans Parish was explored for the entire program to determine if future quantities could be predicted. Individual clinics were also assessed for areas of improvement in distribution. The limited quantity of data for the program resulted in overfitting and poor model performance; however, the same process can be applied if more data is found from years prior to 2015. Efficiently managing this program can allow staff the time to work towards more vaccinations, increasing revenue from the program, and reuniting lost animals with their owners.
